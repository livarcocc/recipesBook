#Feature: Setup Layout
#  As a user of the Recipes book
#  I want to have the app divided in pieces
#  So that I end up with a header, a main area and a footer
#
#  Scenario: Visiting the home page
#    Given I am on the home page
#    Then I should see an area for the "header"
#    And I should see an area for the "main area"
#    And I should see an area for the "footer"
